[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator. This website and other project websites were generated with Jekyll. [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid) is the template language working behind the scenes for including *html* or *markdown* snippets and providing control structures like *if-then-else*. Because of its limited capabilities, things have to be coded slightly different then in other programming languages like *Java* for instance.

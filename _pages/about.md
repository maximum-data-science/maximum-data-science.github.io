![Data Science Venn Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pages{{page.url}}/images/Data_Science_Venn_Diagram.png)*Data Science Venn Diagram (adapted from [(Conway, 2010)](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram))*

I am interested in data science as an intersection of programming, mathematics and statistics applied to a specific domain. This website showcases some of my projects. It was created by using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. The source code of this blog and of my projects is available at [GitHub]({{ site.github }}). If you want to provide feedback or if you have suggestions for interesting projects, you can contact me via [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

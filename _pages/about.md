I am interested in Data Science as an intersection of programming, mathematics and statistics applied to a specific domain. This website showcases some of my projects. It was created by using [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. The source code of this blog and of my projects is available at [GitHub]({{ site.github-repository }}). Feel free to take what you like. If you want to provide feedback or if you have suggestions for interesting projects, you can contact me via [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
